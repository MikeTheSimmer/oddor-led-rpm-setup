## 🛠️ Setup Steps

### 1. Download SimHub
Head over to the official SimHub website and grab the latest version:

### 2. Download the Driver
Download the latest CH340 driver from GitHub:  
📦 [Driver20250117.zip](https://github.com/MikeTheSimmer/oddor-led-rpm-setup/blob/main/driver/Driver20250117.zip)

### 4. Verify Driver Installation
Check if the driver was installed successfully via **Device Manager** (Windows only).  
Make sure your device is **plugged in** — otherwise it won’t show up.
